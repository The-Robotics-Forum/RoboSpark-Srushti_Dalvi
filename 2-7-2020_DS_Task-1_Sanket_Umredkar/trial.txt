After yesterday's session, we hope you are now comfortable with Git and GitHub. 
Now you will be given daily tasks on the basis of the topics taught on that particular day. You need to submit those tasks on Github. Your mentors will be providing you with the link of the repository they have created.
Steps for submitting the tasks:
1. Fork the repo
2. Commit the files 
3. Create a new pull request 
Similar to your day 1 task

The folder name of the task should be:
<Date><Domain name>_Task-1<your full name>
<Date><Domain name>_Task-2<your full name>
E.g. 2-7-2020_DS_Task-1_Sanket_Umredkar
In this folder all files of the respective task.

The best solution of the task will be published on TRF's GitHub profile.

These tasks are a part of your continuous evaluation throughout the workshop
